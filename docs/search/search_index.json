Bevel Preset Groups List Dropdown Allows you to select a preset group. 2. Add new Bevel Preset Group Allows you to add a custom preset group. 3. Remove Bevel Preset Group Allows you to remove the currently selected bevel preset group. 4. Import Bevel Preset Group Appears only if you open a scene that contains a bevel preset group that you don\u2019t have in your preferences. Allows you to save it from scene to your preferences for further usage. Tools Block 1. Toggle Highlight Bevels On/Off Available only in Mesh Edit Mode. Toggles Highlight Bevels function on/off. 2. Smart Select Available only in Mesh Edit Mode. Selects the geometry that has the same assigned bevel radius to the selection. See Quick Start Guide 3. Select by Preset Available only in Mesh Edit Mode. Selects the geometry that has the same assigned bevel radius to the preset that is currently chosen in the list below. See Quick Start Guide 4. Toggle material shader node To visualize bevel effect, the shader node is needed. It is assigned automatically to the object\u2019s materials at first add-on usage on this object. But you can toggle it manually by using this button. 5. Reset Selection On Object Mode it resets the whole object to default state. In Mesh Edit Mode it sets zero bevel radius to the selection or, if no geometry selected, to all object\u2019s geometry. Presets List Please see Quick Start Guide for instructions. 1. Color Marker Color that will be used to show this bevel radius when the Highlight Bevels function is on. These 6 presets will be also included into the Pie Menu, clockwise. Triangle direction on the icon corresponds the position of this option in the Pie Menu. 2. Radius value and measurement unit Radius value and measurement unit, both editable. 3. Assign button Assigns the corresponding preset to the selection. Render Preview Please see Quick Start Guide for instruction. 1. Render Preview Toggle Toggles Render Preview mode. 2. Preview Material Override Toggle Toggles overriding material of the selected objects with bevel shader for slear bevel view. 3. Automatically Preview Material Override Toggle The previous function is toggled synchronously with the Render Preview Toggle. 4. preview Render Quality Three options for preview render quality (Low, Medium and High). The first button (Revert/Custom) allows to restore the user\u2019s settings that were before one of built-in quality options was activated. If you will be baking normal maps, please make sure that you\u2019re using the High option for best results. Preferences Keymap Calls keymap settings window where you can set custom hotkeys for the add-on\u2019s functions. Reset Preferences Resets Zen BBQ add-on preferences to its default state (including the bevel presets!), Repair Materials Removes all bevel override shader nodes from user\u2019s materials and brings back the bevel shader node if it was used in that material. Global Cleanup Cleans up all objects and user\u2019s materials in scene from Zen BBQ, removes Zen BBQ default material and shader nodes from the scene. Common Smart Select Accuracy Adjusts accuracy of Smart Select and Select by Preset functions. In most cases, the default value of 10% is fine. Polygons boundary loop only When you assign bevel in polygon editing mode, you can assign it to the boundary adges of selection only by turning this option on. Ask for switching to Cycles Zen BBQ requires Cycles render engine to show you result, so it automatically switches it when it\u2019s needed. For example if you click \u201cRender Preview\u201d in a new scene. With this option disabled, Zen BBQ shall not ask for confirmation once it needs to switch render engine to Cycles.

Bevel will be assigned. If you are in Edit Mode, Highlight Bevels function will also be activated. Previewing the result In Zen BBQ Panel, click the large \u201cRender Preview\u201d button. It is required to switch the render engine to Cycles, if it was not done before. Click OK. See the result! You can toggle the Render Preview mode by clicking the same button. In Preview Render Quality Block you can choose the desired settings. Revert button reverts to the saved user\u2019s settings.

You can toggle on/off the Edge Highlighting by clicking the corresponding button in Zen BBQ Panel (currently available in Edit Mesh Mode only) Managing Presets You can choose one of the buit-in preset groups in the dropdown menu. Each preset group contains six presets, they are correspondingly shown in the Pie Menu. Highlight Bevels function also uses colors corresponding to the currently selected preset group. By default there are groups for centimeters, millimeters, meters and inches. You can edit the default presets by clicking on them in the list and choosing the desired value or unit. You can create your own preset groups by clicking \u201c+\u201d button. It will ask the name of the new group and the desired units, but you can change units later. It is not required to have the same units in list, you can mix it, for example, having millimeters and centimeters in one list. You can delete bevel preset group by clicking \u201c-\u201d button. You can reset it to the default state by clicking \u201cReset Preferences\u201d in \u201cPreferences\u201d panel. Warning, it will also reset all other settings to the defaults.
