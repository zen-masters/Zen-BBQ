If you\u2019re unfamiliar with that process, please refer to the Quick Start section. This guide explains how to transfer bevel data from Blender to Marmoset Toolbag 5 using vertex color masking. Bevels are created in Blender with the addon, converted to a vertex color mask, and exported with the mesh. In Toolbag, the mesh is imported, a material is assigned, the bevel shader is enabled with vertex color masking, and the bevel width is set to match the maximum value used in Blender to achieve consistent visual results. Blender We\u2019ll begin with a scene that contains an object with bevels already created. Our goal is to transfer the bevel settings into Marmoset Toolbag and ensure that the bevels appear the same and have varying widths according to what we set up in Blender. In this test scene, we have an object with bevel samples of 1, 2, 3, and 5 cm. The last sample has no bevel applied. Let\u2019s add a modifier that will create a Vertex Color Mask for use in Marmoset Toolbag. In the addon panel, expand the Tools section and click the Node VC Mask button. A Geometry Nodes modifier will be added to the object, dynamically generating the vertex color and automatically updating it to reflect any changes in geometry or bevels. Tip You can freely modify the Geometry Nodes of this modifier to suit your needs. However, the next time you assign it to a new object in the same scene, it will use the modified version. If you want the addon to generate a fresh, default version of the node setup, simply remove all instances of the modifier from the scene. A new one will be created automatically. To preview the result, you need to make the generated vertex color layer active and enable viewport settings to show mesh attributes. Expand the Color Attributes list and select the layer named N_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask . Switch the viewport render mode to Solid . Then open the render settings and enable both Attribute and Flat shading. The Flat option is optional, but when enabled, it displays the vertex color unaffected by lighting. Here\u2019s the result of the modifier: As you can see, the vertex color is red because only the red channel is used in the modifier settings. To understand the logic behind the gradient values, let\u2019s refer to the Marmoset Toolbag documentation on Vertex Color Masking . If you need more control, you can select a Vertex Color Mask channel to vary the size of bevels within a single material. Vertex masking uses the color value as a multiplier on the Bevel Width setting. For example, if Bevel Width is set to 5mm, a vertex color value of 0.5 would create a size of 2.5mm for that region. You can think of the Bevel Width setting as the maximum size in this case, with vertex colors being used to reduce the size where necessary. This means we need to create a mask where the widest bevel is represented by the brightest color (1.0 in color channel value), and the others will be dimmer depending on their width. That\u2019s exactly what we see in the final vertex color: the widest bevel (5 cm) is the brightest, and areas with no bevel are completely black. Marmoset Toolbag Let\u2019s configure the Marmoset Toolbag shader to display bevels. Import the test object into Toolbag. Tip For export/import, it\u2019s best to use a format that supports vertex color. The default FBX settings are a good choice. Here is the result after importing into Toolbag: Tip You can adjust the Albedo color to enhance the highlight visibility. In the image above, the Albedo color is R:91 G:85 B:102. Also, in the material\u2019s Reflectivity settings, Metalness is set to 1.0. Right after importing the object into Toolbag, the bevels are not yet visible. To display them correctly, the material and render settings need to be configured. As noted in the documentation, the render mode must be changed to allow bevels to appear: Note: The bevel shader is not supported in the Raster renderer. Make sure Hybrid or Ray Tracing is selected to preview the effect. Bevels can be baked to textures to view the result in Raster mode as well. In the render settings, switch the Render Mode to Ray Tracing . In the object\u2019s material settings, find the Surface tab. Open the dropdown labeled Normals and select Bevel . After changing the normal type, the panel will switch to the one we need for bevel configuration. We only need to adjust two parameters: Bevel Width (mm) and Vertex Color Mask . According to Toolbag\u2019s documentation, we should set Bevel Width to match the widest bevel in our model. Let\u2019s go back to Blender. In Blender, select the model and use the operator Show Max Bevel by Material from the Tools panel. In the popup, select the unit of measurement used in Toolbag. You can find this in the Toolbag\u2019s bevel field labeled Bevel Width (mm) . Confirm your choice by clicking Ok . As a result, we see that the maximum bevel width in our object is 50 mm . Enter this value in Toolbag\u2019s Bevel Width (mm) field in the material settings. As expected, we now have bevels sized at 50 mm. Next, let\u2019s add the influence of the vertex color map. Change the Vertex Color Map setting from None to one of the available vertex color channels in the model. In our case, it\u2019s the R channel. The final result shows a clear variation in bevel width according to what was set up using the Zen BBQ addon.","title":"How to use vertex color mask"},{"location":"guide_using_vc_mask/#quick-guide-how-to-use-vertex-color-mask","text":"This tutorial does not aim to teach you how to create bevels using the addon.

The first button (Revert/Custom) allows to restore the user\u2019s settings that were before one of built-in quality options was activated. If you will be baking normal maps, please make sure that you\u2019re using the High option for best results. Live Boolean You can find the example from the animated image above in scene \u201cCarburetor\u201d in Help/Examples panel ZenBBQ has Live Boolean support. To adjust the bevel radius for at the intersection surfaces, select the desired object and use the Live Boolean (default) bevel radius at the Advanced subpanel (as shown in the animated image above). Tools This panel offers utility tools. Create VC Mask Create vertex color attributes using bevel values. Tip Note: Since this is an operator that generates vertex color, it does not take object modifiers into account. This also means it cannot process Live Booleans. To bake such data into vertex color, you need to apply the modifier stack. The changes must be made permanent. If you need to keep the modifier stack and still export the model with up-to-date vertex color to another application, consider using an alternative method of generating vertex color. Use Active VC Layer - Use active vertex color layer instead of creating a new one. Tip The operator creates a new color layer named G_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask , where the first letter G indicates that this is a generated layer. The new layer always has the following properties: Domain - Face Corner , Data Type - Color . However, if you need a different type of layer or want to add the generated mask to an existing one, simply make the desired layer active and enable the Use Active VC Layer option. Color Channel - Choose which color channel to use. Red - Red channel Green - Green channel Blue - Blue channel Alpha - Alpha channel Red, Green, Blue - Red, Green, Blue channels Red, Green, Blue, Alpha - Red, Green, Blue Alpha channels Tip You can choose any channel for the generated data, or multiple channels according to the documentation of the application that will use this data. If you\u2019re unsure, or if you\u2019re not using vertex color to transmit other types of data, select the last option with all channels enabled, including Alpha. This will help prevent additional errors, though it may slightly increase the data size of the model. Add to Existing - Add generated color to the existing vertex color instead of replacing it. Tip If you\u2019re using vertex color to transmit other types of data, enable the Add to Existing option. This allows you to overwrite only the channel specified in the Color Channel setting of this operator, without affecting the other channels. Note: The specified channel will be completely overwritten. Data inside the channel is not merged. Show Max Bevel by Material Show the maximum bevel value for the active or all materials. This operator displays the minimum and maximum bevel values of the object, including a breakdown by materials. Use All Materials - Search for bevel values among all materials in the object. If this option is disabled, you will receive data only for the active material. Units - Measurement units. Select the units in which you need to get the data. The data is displayed in a popup window. Here you can see the unit of measurement ( CENTIMETERS ), the material name ( Aluminium ), and the minimum and maximum bevel values for that material. Node VC Mask Create geometry node modifier and assign it to selected objects. This operator creates a Geometry Nodes modifier named ZenBBQ_BevelsToVertexColor for the selected object and generates a vertex color mask based on the bevel settings. This process is dynamic, and the resulting vertex color will update as you modify the geometry or adjust bevel settings using the add-on. The modifier also dynamically accounts for Live Boolean operations and the Live Boolean (default) bevel radius setting defined in the add-on preferences. If you have created more than one Boolean, make sure that this modifier is placed at the end of the modifier stack to reflect the current state of the geometry correctly, following best practices for modifier stack order. In the modifier settings, you can specify which channel(s) the mask should be generated in. You can select more than one channel. Processing the Alpha channel is currently not possible using Geometry Nodes. Therefore, if you need to use the Alpha channel, please use the Create VC Mask operator. The Default Radius field in the modifier is informational only. You cannot change its value directly. It is controlled via the Live Boolean (default) bevel radius setting and serves only as a convenient visual reference in the modifier. The operator creates a vertex color layer named N_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask , where the letter N indicates that the data in this layer is generated using nodes. After the operator creates the modifier, you can use it by simply adding the modifier manually or together with your own node setups. However, in that case, you need to create the layer named N_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask manually. Preferences Keymap Calls keymap settings window where you can set custom hotkeys for the add-on\u2019s functions. Reset Preferences Resets Zen BBQ add-on preferences to its default state (including the bevel presets!), Repair Materials Removes all bevel override shader nodes from user\u2019s materials and brings back the bevel shader node if it was used in that material. Global Cleanup Cleans up all objects and user\u2019s materials in scene from Zen BBQ, removes Zen BBQ default material and shader nodes from the scene. Common Smart Select Accuracy Adjusts accuracy of Smart Select and Select by Preset functions. In most cases, the default value of 10% is fine. Polygons boundary loop only When you assign bevel in polygon editing mode, you can assign it to the boundary adges of selection only by turning this option on. Ask for switching to Cycles Zen BBQ requires Cycles render engine to show you result, so it automatically switches it when it\u2019s needed. For example if you click \u201cRender Preview\u201d in a new scene. With this option disabled, Zen BBQ shall not ask for confirmation once it needs to switch render engine to Cycles.

Tip Note: Since this is an operator that generates vertex color, it does not take object modifiers into account. This also means it cannot process Live Booleans. To bake such data into vertex color, you need to apply the modifier stack. The changes must be made permanent. If you need to keep the modifier stack and still export the model with up-to-date vertex color to another application, consider using an alternative method of generating vertex color. Use Active VC Layer - Use active vertex color layer instead of creating a new one. Tip The operator creates a new color layer named G_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask , where the first letter G indicates that this is a generated layer. The new layer always has the following properties: Domain - Face Corner , Data Type - Color . However, if you need a different type of layer or want to add the generated mask to an existing one, simply make the desired layer active and enable the Use Active VC Layer option. Color Channel - Choose which color channel to use. Red - Red channel Green - Green channel Blue - Blue channel Alpha - Alpha channel Red, Green, Blue - Red, Green, Blue channels Red, Green, Blue, Alpha - Red, Green, Blue Alpha channels Tip You can choose any channel for the generated data, or multiple channels according to the documentation of the application that will use this data. If you\u2019re unsure, or if you\u2019re not using vertex color to transmit other types of data, select the last option with all channels enabled, including Alpha. This will help prevent additional errors, though it may slightly increase the data size of the model. Add to Existing - Add generated color to the existing vertex color instead of replacing it. Tip If you\u2019re using vertex color to transmit other types of data, enable the Add to Existing option. This allows you to overwrite only the channel specified in the Color Channel setting of this operator, without affecting the other channels. Note: The specified channel will be completely overwritten. Data inside the channel is not merged.","title":"Create VC Mask"},{"location":"npanel/#show-max-bevel-by-material","text":"Show the maximum bevel value for the active or all materials.

This operator creates a Geometry Nodes modifier named ZenBBQ_BevelsToVertexColor for the selected object and generates a vertex color mask based on the bevel settings. This process is dynamic, and the resulting vertex color will update as you modify the geometry or adjust bevel settings using the add-on. The modifier also dynamically accounts for Live Boolean operations and the Live Boolean (default) bevel radius setting defined in the add-on preferences. If you have created more than one Boolean, make sure that this modifier is placed at the end of the modifier stack to reflect the current state of the geometry correctly, following best practices for modifier stack order. In the modifier settings, you can specify which channel(s) the mask should be generated in. You can select more than one channel. Processing the Alpha channel is currently not possible using Geometry Nodes. Therefore, if you need to use the Alpha channel, please use the Create VC Mask operator. The Default Radius field in the modifier is informational only. You cannot change its value directly. It is controlled via the Live Boolean (default) bevel radius setting and serves only as a convenient visual reference in the modifier. The operator creates a vertex color layer named N_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask , where the letter N indicates that the data in this layer is generated using nodes. After the operator creates the modifier, you can use it by simply adding the modifier manually or together with your own node setups. However, in that case, you need to create the layer named N_ZenBBQ_VC_Mask manually.","title":"Node VC Mask"},{"location":"npanel/#preferences","text":"","title":"Preferences"},{"location":"npanel/#keymap","text":"Calls keymap settings window where you can set custom hotkeys for the add-on\u2019s functions.","title":"Keymap"},{"location":"npanel/#reset-preferences","text":"Resets Zen BBQ add-on preferences to its default state (including the bevel presets!),","title":"Reset Preferences"},{"location":"npanel/#repair-materials","text":"Removes all bevel override shader nodes from user\u2019s materials and brings back the bevel shader node if it was used in that material.","title":"Repair Materials"},{"location":"npanel/#global-cleanup","text":"Cleans up all objects and user\u2019s materials in scene from Zen BBQ, removes Zen BBQ default material and shader nodes from the scene.","title":"Global Cleanup"},{"location":"npanel/#common","text":"","title":"Common"},{"location":"npanel/#smart-select-accuracy","text":"Adjusts accuracy of Smart Select and Select by Preset functions.
